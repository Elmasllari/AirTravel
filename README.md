Your goal is to visit all 6 cities as quickly as possible without running out of fuel. However, as you continue your flight, the weather slowly gets more extreme and "unfriendly to planes".



Tips:

- Avoid the black lightning clouds, colliding with those will cause your plane to crash as lightning is probably not good for planes

- If possible, try to let the wind help push you in the right direction to spend less fuel

- Going faster consumes fuel at a faster rate so make sure to balance speed with fuel!


Controls:

Right / Left Arrow keys - rotate the plane

Up / Down Arrow keys - accelerate or decelerate the plane

ESC - pause the game
